# Flashlight.js

Flashlight.js is a really simple pluggin that converts the site into an exploratory experience by covering the entire window with a black (configurable) canvas and transforms the mouse into a flashlight (hence, the name).

Install and configuration are purposely simple. Just import the flashlight.js file:

```javascript
<script src="flashlight.js"> </script>
```

And call the initialization funtion: 

```javascript
flashlight();
```

And that's it! Here's what you get:

## Options

* Radius: Controls the radius of the flashlight
* More to come...
